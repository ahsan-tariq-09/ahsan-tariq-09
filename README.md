# Hey there, I’m Ahsan 👋

Welcome to my corner of GitHub!  
I’m a Computer Science student exploring the intersection of **software development** and **creative problem solving**.

---

## 🔧 Languages & Tools
- ☕ **Java** – building strong foundations in object-oriented programming.  
- λ **Haskell** – learning to think in recursion, purity, and functional elegance.  
- 🐍 Python – scripting, experimenting, and automating.  

---

## 🚀 What I’m Working On
- Java projects from coursework and beyond.  
- Exploring functional programming with Haskell to broaden my perspective.  
- Small experiments with Python for quick ideas and automation.  
- Building my problem-solving skills through coding challenges and competitions.  

---

## 📂 Featured Repositories 
- [NeurIPS Code Golf](#) – concise problem-solving in Python.  Developing programs to solve a variety of tasks (all drawn from the ARC-AGI benchmark suite) using the fewest possible number of characters.

---

## 🌱 Current Goals
- Master the fundamentals of **Java, Python, and C/C++** in the coming year.  
- Apply functional programming concepts from **Haskell** into real-world problem solving.  
- Collaborate on open-source or faculty-led projects.
