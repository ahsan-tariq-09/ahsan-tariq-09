# Hey there, I’m Ahsan 👋

Welcome to my corner of GitHub!  
I’m a Computer Science student exploring the intersection of **software development** and **creative problem solving**.

---

## 🔧 Languages & Tools
- ☕ **Java** – building strong foundations in object-oriented programming.  
- 🐍 **Python** – scripting, experimenting, and automating.  
- ⚛️ 📝**Typescript and React.js** - building fast, scalable front-end interfaces with clean, type-safe components.

---

## 🚀 What I’m Working On
- Java projects from coursework and beyond.  
- Exploring functional programming with Haskell to broaden my perspective.  
- Small experiments with Python for quick ideas and automation.  
- Building my problem-solving skills through coding challenges and competitions.
- Learning Javascript and React.js for Web-Development to work on Knox Makerspace server
- Working on Making a Website to help Freshman with career and course navigation and guidance at Knox College

---

## 📂 Featured Repositories 
- [NeurIPS Code Golf](https://github.com/ahsan-500mbps/neurips-2025-google-code-golf-championship) – concise problem-solving in Python.  Developing programs to solve a variety of tasks (all drawn from the ARC-AGI benchmark suite) using the fewest possible number of characters.
- [KG-RAG-Physio-Chatbot](https://github.com/ahsan-500mbps/KG-RAG-Physio-Chatbot) - Design and Implementation of a Knowledge-Graph-Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Chatbot System for Physical Therapy (inprogress)

---

## 🌱 Current Goals

* Strengthen mastery of **Java, Python, TypeScript/React, and C++**, with a focus on writing cleaner, scalable code.
* Build deeper fluency in **Haskell** and apply functional-programming patterns to real project architectures.
* Develop and deploy real systems: the **Knox Makerspace server**, **Freshman guidance website**, and **KG-RAG Physio Chatbot**.
* Contribute to open-source or faculty-led research projects to sharpen engineering and collaboration skills.
